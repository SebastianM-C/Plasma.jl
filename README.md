# Plasma.jl

(WIP) Plasma.jl gives scientists the ability to fully model 6D collisionless and electrostatic kinetic plasmas. This is the only package capable of fully solving the Vlasov model: a set of 6D, non-linear, time-dependent integro-differential equations that fully describe plasma behavior.
