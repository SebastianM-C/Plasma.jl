# Plasma.jl

Plasma.jl is a solver package for analysis and high performance simulation of 6D collisionless and electrostatic kinetic plasmas. It uses the full Vlasov and Vlasov-Poisson systems of equations to predict plasma evolution with high accuracy. It does this using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) at a greatly reduced cost compared with other numerical methods.

Knowledge of how a plasma moves is quintessential to solving controlled fusion and understanding important astrophysical objects. However, knowing how a plasma moves requires one to know the position and velocity of every particle at every point in time. Following a kinetic description, such knowledge is now accessible to Plasma.jl users.
