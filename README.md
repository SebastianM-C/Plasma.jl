# Plasma.jl

What it does
Why it matters
(WIP) Plasma.jl gives scientists the ability to fully model 6D collisionless and electrostatic kinetic plasmas. This is the only package capable of fully solving the Vlasov model: a set of 6D, non-linear, time-dependent integro-differential equations that fully describe plasma behavior.
